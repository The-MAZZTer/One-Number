Here's how to use this extension, assuming you have it checked out via 
git:

- Open Chrome and first disable any Web Store copy of One Number you 
have via the Extensions page.
- On the Extensions page make sure Developer mode is checked/expanded, 
and click Load unpacked extension.
- Select the "src" folder inside your checked-out git repo and click OK.
- One Number should load and run immediately.

To update One Number:

- If Chrome is not running (including the tray icon) you can just pull 
in the latest changes and Chrome will load them when it starts up.  If 
Chrome is running when you update:
- Go to the Extensions page.
- In older versions of Chrome you may have to expand Developer mode.  In 
newer versions you will have to expand the small arrow next to the 
"unpacked" One Number.
- Click Reload to pull in the latest changes.
